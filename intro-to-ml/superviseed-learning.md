* algorithm learns from data and pridict from it
* it is a labeled data
* goal:- generalize future data without overfitting them. this part is called training.
* x be inputted data y be label either continuous or discrete values.

## Representation of Data
* matrix form input in let x with m item and n features
* in output y is output matrix of m X 1

## Output
1. Regression=> Continuous values=> housing,stock,pice,cgpa => f(x) -> y where xbelong to R^n and y belongs to R
2. Classification=> discrete label=> count of objects => f(x) -> y where xbelong to R^n and y belongs to [1 .... k]

## process
training data -> Algorithm -> hypothysis(h) ->accepts testing data(unseen data) -> generates y test result(prediction)

## Algorithm
1. linear regression
2. logistic
3. sum
4. Neural

**Overfitting** one lael result must not overlap with other.

## Example
1. spam detection
2. Document classification
3. NLP
4. Image Classification
5. Sequence
6. Predective analysis
